The original six dataset filenames are:

ECIDs.cts_75.Mapping.padded.main.cumulative.summary_table.tsv
GOProcIDs.cts_75.Mapping.padded.main.cumulative.summary_table.tsv
GOFuncIDs.cts_75.Mapping.padded.main.cumulative.summary_table.tsv
PFamIDs.cts_75.Mapping.padded.main.cumulative.summary_table.tsv
TIGRFamIDs.cts_75.Mapping.padded.main.cumulative.summary_table.tsv
Phyllo_Genus.cts_75.combined.main.summary_table.xls

The datasets are read into the R code and grouped together in a list in the exact order above. Each set is then further divided into three subsets based
on city: CA, DE, and HF in that order. Thus, the final output for each dataset-city would look like the following:
dataset-1.1.csv, dataset-1.2.csv, dataset-1.3.csv, dataset-2.1.csv, and so on. For instance, dataset-1.1.csv corresponds to the replications from the
ECIDs dataset and the CA city subset. Dataset-1.2.csv represents ECIDs from DE, and dataset-1.3.csv represents ECIDs from HF. 

To include the HF.group in the analysis, a new third "drought" replication was created via imputation. More specifically, the new replication,
called "PHYLLO30", is the average of the other two drought replications.
 
Interestingly, some datasets produced different results depending on whether the default analysis method, or an alternate (involving the regeneration of counts with
a common dispersion). For the sake of thoroughness, files created from both methods have been included in the Outputs folder. The following reported no signficant differences, and
thus were eliminated from the list of outputs:

ECIDs, DE group (Set 1, subset 2, method 1)
ECIDs, HF group (Set 1, subset 3, method 1)
GOProcIDs, CA group (Set 2, subset 1, method 1)
GOProcIDs, DE group (Set 2, subset 2, method 1)
GOFuncIDs, CA group (Set 3, subset 1, both methods)
GOFuncIDs, DE group (Set 3, subset 2, method 1)
TIGRFamIDs, DE group (Set 5, subset 2, method 1)
TIGRFamIDs, HF group (Set 5, subset 3, method 1)
Phyllo_Genus, HF group (Set 6, subset 3, method 1)
